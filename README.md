## ▶️ How to Play

### Option 1: Run the Pre-Built Game
- Open the folder: `Super Adventure (Play)`
- Double-click `SuperAdventure.exe` to launch the game

> ⚠️ Make sure to **extract the full repository** if you downloaded it as a `.zip`.  
> Do **not** try to run the `.exe` directly from inside the zip — it won’t work properly.

### Option 2: Download Just the Game
- Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SuperAdventure/releases) section
- Download `SuperAdventure_Play.zip`
- Extract and run `SuperAdventure.exe`
